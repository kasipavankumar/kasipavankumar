üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, Greetings.

I'm a full stack developer in the making & my focus is towards designing rich & fluid user experiences backed by performant web applications developed using React.

Most of my applications are built around the MERN stack with interests also flowing towards GatsbyJS, NextJS, GraphQL & Svelte.

[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.in/dp/0132350882) has taught me to develop applications with an easy to understand & most importantly, a maintainable codebase.

I post useful articles on my [blog](https://dkpk.tech/blog/) & often write answers on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/D-Kasi-Pavan-Kumar) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7469926/kasipavankumar?tab=answers).

Space tends to fascinate most people & I'm one of them. Star gazing is one of my hobbies & [Betelguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse) is my favorite star in the night sky.
