Greetings. üëã

My name is D. Kasi Pavan Kumar, a full stack developer from India. My prime focus is towards designing fluid user experiences backed by performant & scalable web applications.

My competence is with the MERN stack along with React based frameworks like [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) & [NextJS](https://nextjs.org). I'm currently diving deep into Docker üê≥.

After taking a few [lessons from Uncle Bob](https://youtu.be/7EmboKQH8lM), I have felt the essence of [Clean Code](https://links.kasipavankumar.in/clean-code) in writing easy to understand and most importantly, a maintainable codebase.

Coming to the online presence, you can find writeups at my [blog](https://kasipavankumar.in/blog/) & often on [Quora](https://links.kasipavankumar.in/quora), [Stackoverflow](https://links.kasipavankumar.in/stackoverflow) & [Medium](https://links.kasipavankumar.in/medium).

I'm one of those people who is fascinated by the space. One day, I came across the possibility of [Earth going rogue](https://youtu.be/gLZJlf5rHVs) due to a star passing close to the Solar System ‚Äî scary & interesting at the same time. So, [I wrote an article](https://links.kasipavankumar.in/rogue-earth-hypothesis) describing my thoughts on how that would progress. If you would ask me the favourite star, that would be [Betelguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse).
